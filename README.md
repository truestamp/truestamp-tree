# @truestamp/tree

This library provides a TypeScript/JavaScript API for creating Merkle trees, and validating Merkle inclusion proofs.

Data provided to create the tree is required to already be in binary form (`Uint8Array`) and all
internal operations are performed on binary data.

The library provides several encodings for Merkle inclusion proofs, any one of which is acceptable for validation.

This library doesn't hash original data or provide a hash function, you have to provide hashed (or arbitrary binary data of fixed size).

The library performs extensive compile time (TypeScript), and run time, validation of the incoming data to ensure correctness and safety at the possible expense of raw performance. That being said, it is still extremely fast, able to round-trip process a 1,000 item tree in about 20 milliseconds.

## Security Notes

In order to help prevent the possibility of a second pre-image attack (see [^1] [^2] [^3]) the data leaf nodes provided to construct the tree are prefixed with a `0x00` byte. All inner nodes of the tree are prefixed with a `0x01` byte. These prefixes are also applied during the validation step.

An additional step that can be taken to avoid second pre-image attack vulnerability is to pre-hash your leaves *using a different hash function* (see [^3]) than the function provided to construct the tree so that `H(x) != H'(x)`. For example, use `sha3-256` to pre-hash the leaves, and use `sha2-256` to construct the tree.

This implementation is potentially vulnerable to a forgery attack for an unbalanced Merkle Tree (see [^5]), wherein, in an unbalanced Merkle Tree, the last leaf node can be duplicated to create an artificially balanced tree. This can result in the same root hash. To avoid this vulnerability, do not construct an unbalanced Merkle Trees (where the length of the `data` array provided is not a power of 2). This library provides an optional `requireBalanced` configuration flag that will throw an `Error` if the `data.length` is not a power of 2.

## Install

```sh
npm install @truestamp/tree
```

## Sample Usage

Node.js:

```javascript
import { Tree } from '@truestamp/tree';

// Using the Node.js crypto SHA256 hash function for this example.
// You can provide your own hash function.
function sha256(data) {
  return crypto.createHash('sha256').update(data).digest()
}

// Generate a sample 16 element hashed data array
const rawData = Array.from(16).map(() => Math.random())
const data = rawData.map((x) => { return sha256(x.toString()) })

// Construct the Merkle tree
const t = new Tree(data, sha256)

// - or to reject unbalanced trees -
// const t = new Tree(data, sha256, { requireBalanced: true })

// Get the root of the tree for later use
const r = t.root()

// Pick (and store a verifiable copy) of one of the data elements that will be validated.
// (you can do the same for every data element to store and later verify )
const d = data[Math.floor(Math.random() * data.length)]

// Extract the Merkle inclusion proof for that data element to store
// alongside your pristine copy of the data.
// (you can do the same for every data element to store and later verify )
const p = t.proofObject(d)

// At any time in the future, validate your proof by providing
// the stored root, the proof, and data. You need to use the same
// hash function the tree was originally created with.
console.log('validated?', Tree.validate(r, p, d, sha256)) // returns true or false
```

## API Documentation

The [TypeScript API documentation](https://truestamp.github.io/truestamp-tree/) for this project is generated and published upon each new release.

## Performance

Using the example code on a MacBook Pro and the following size sample data sets of random elements and the Node.js `crypto` SHA-256 function:

### `1,000` data elements

* creates a tree in `13.03ms`
* extracts the Merkle root from the tree in `0.154ms`
* extracts a single Merkle inclusion proof in `3.42ms`
* validates that proof in `1.15ms`

### `1,000,000` data elements

* creates a tree in `3.490s`
* extracts the Merkle root from the tree in `0.204ms`
* extracts a single Merkle inclusion proof in `23.139ms`
* validates that proof in `1.533ms`
